# Plotting-in-R

This was an assignment for STATS 782 (Statistical Computing) at University of Auckland. Even though I can and have done more impressive and useful
things in R, even for this paper, I'm including this because it's a nice visual example of some of my skills in R (and the first plot in particular was actually pretty tricky).
I am also aware that producing complex graphs such as these from scratch in base R is not really a useful skill in and of itself given the existence of for example ggplot2 or plotly.

There are also far too many comments in the code, this was what they wanted from us at that point in the semester. I will remove them and generally tidy this up when I have more time.

I have included the RMarkdown code as well as a published html file for anyone unfamiliar with/unable to access RMarkdown.
